## Introduction
 
* "He who is only an athlete is too crude, too vulgar, too much a savage. He who is a scholar only is too soft to effeminate. The ideal citizen is the scholar athlete, the man of thought and the man of action."
-plato

  * I like to learn, I like to think, and I like to teach. I work to be better than yesterday. I want to be stronger, smarter, and altogether better.
